# When your process runs, it can look up all the environment variables you defined in the pod spec.
# The pod’s name,IP,and namespace will be exposed through the POD_NAME,POD_IP, and POD_NAMESPACE environment variables,respectively.
# The name of the node the container is running on will be exposed through the NODE_NAME variable.
# The name of the serviceaccount is made available through the SERVICE_ACCOUNT environment variable.
# You’re also creating two environment variables that will hold the amount of CPU requested for this container and the maximum amount of memory the container is allowed to consume.

# For environment variables exposing resource limits or requests, you specify a divisor.
# The actual value of the limit or the request will be divided by the divisor and the result exposed through the environment variable.
# You’re setting the divisor for CPU requests to 1m (one milli-core,or one one-thousandth of a CPU core).
# Because you’ve set the CPU request to 15m, the environment variable CONTAINER_CPU_REQUEST_MILLICORES will be set to 15.
# Likewise, you set the memory limit to 4Mi (4 mebibytes) and the divisor to 1Ki (1 Kibibyte), so the CONTAINER_MEMORY_LIMIT_KIBIBYTES environment variable will be set to 4096.
